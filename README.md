# TCLWORKSHOP

TCL is a dynamic scripting language that is used for scripting, automation and rapid prototyping tasks. In TCL all data, commands and even programming constructs are represented as strings. This approach provides a high degree of flexibility and allows for powerful string manipulation capabilities.

One of the core features of TCL is it’s command centric nature. TCL commands are used to perform operations and manipulate data. The language provides a set of built-in commands for common tasks such as file handling, string manipulation, control flow and mathematical operations.

Overall, TCL is valued for it’s simplicity, flexibility and ease of integration making it a versatile scripting language for a range of applications and domains.
